# AO-Auto-Login
Anarchy Online launcher and auto login app

This app lets you create a list of accounts, and choose which account(s) to launch and auto login. Depending on which AO Engine you're running, and your drive speed, you may need to adjust some settings

If you want it to also set each top-left position of the AO window to a specific place, this will also adjust when launching. This is helpful if you want them all to the top, or on a different monitor without having to move them all yourself

Tooltips should answer most question on the controls.

Note - if AO needs a patch then you'll need to launch AO through the normal launcher and let it patch before this app will work again. This is a limitation of AO itself.

**1.0.1.0** - Updated GUI a bit, easier to add multiple server entries to connect to and their independent account lists, such as AO Live and AO Test servers

**1.0.0.1** - Added combobox to be able to list multiple AO installations, such as having old + new client and being able to choose between which to launch. Same with command line arguments in case those change. Default args are launching "[..]\anarchyonline.exe IA700453413 IP7505 DU"
