# AO-Auto-Login
Anarchy Online launcher and auto login app

This app lets you create a list of accounts, and choose which account(s) to launch and auto login. Depending on which AO Engine you're running, and your drive speed, you may need to adjust some settings

If you want it to also set each top-left position of the AO window to a specific place, this will also adjust when launching. This is helpful if you want them all to the top, or on a different monitor without having to move them all yourself

Tooltips should answer most question on the controls.

Note - if AO needs a patch then you'll need to launch AO through the normal launcher and let it patch before this app will work again. This is a limitation of AO itself.
